# TensorFlowConvnet
MNIST practice with Tensorflow convnet. Reached around ~95% accuracy within less than 1 epoch.

# Convolutional Neural Network on MNIST #
This is a demo to prepare input data from Medical-CNN and see how well/how fast the program does in convolving and stepping.


Result: 96% accuracy - not too shabby at all!
